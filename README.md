**Moin! Welcome to my GitHub profile!**

I started my career as Sales Manager in Hospitality industry, later on acquired a B.Sc. in Sociology, started over in Adult Education - now I'm based in Hamburg since 2009 already and deeply into all things HR with focus on IT / Tech roles. And I love both sides of that, honestly! Even learned some coding in the meantime 😎

Currently, I am working as a Tech Recruiter for [EDEKA DIGITAL ](https://digital.edeka) the IT experts within Germany's biggest supermarket retailer [EDEKA](https://www.edeka.de).

Want to talk about job opportunities, get resume or career advice, look at IT from a recruiter's perspective, or simply talk about nerdy stuff like Video Games  and make friends? Let's get in touch 😊
